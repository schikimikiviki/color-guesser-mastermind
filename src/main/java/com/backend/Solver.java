//    Responsibilities:
//
//    Initialize the game:
//    Generate all possible codes (e.g., 6 colors, length 4 → 1296 codes).
//    Make guesses:
//    Pick a code from the current candidate list.
//    Could be random, first in list, or based on a smarter algorithm (Knuth’s algorithm).
//    Get feedback from the game (number of correct positions/colors).
//    Filter candidates:
//    Use CandidateFilterTask or similar logic to remove impossible codes.
//    Repeat until solved:
//    Keep guessing and filtering until only one candidate remains or the guess matches the secret code.
//    Outcome:
//    You end up with the correct code.
//    Along the way, the candidate list shrinks after each guess.
